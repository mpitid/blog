It's been a while since I've written anything for this site. In the
meantime, Hakyll_ has changed significantly enough to break my previous
setup and I've been itching to try a different site generator.

After a bit of research, I've decided to try out Pelican_. It's tailored
to blog sites, has comprehensive documentation and is written in
Python_, which means it will be easier for me to wrap my head around it
if I have to.

While I've been using Markdown_ heavily for the past few years, it has
some serious limitations when it comes to writing extensive
documentation in it (captured succinctly in a `blog by Eric
Holscher`__). Hence, I'm taking this opportunity to re-evaluate
reStructuredText_, and probably Asciidoc_ at some later point.

I have migrated most of the old content, and I'll be updating the theme
in the upcoming weeks as I add new entries.
