My name is Michael Pitidis, and I work as a Software Developer. Before
that I studied *Electrical & Computer Engineering* at the `National
Technical University of Athens`__, followed by an *MSc in Informatics*
at the `University of Edinburgh`__.

This Site
=========

This is my personal website containing information about various free
software `projects`_, as well as any `thoughts, ideas or findings`_ I
occasionally feel like sharing with the world -- mostly related to
programming languages and everyday GNU/Linux administration.

Geeky Stuff
===========

Nowadays I program mostly in Scala_ and Python_. I've enjoyed functional
programming languages in the past such as Erlang_, Haskell_, and OCaml_.
When forced I may resort to C or even Java (yikes!). I once decided to
learn Perl but soon stopped, fearing for my sanity.

.. _Haskell: https://www.haskell.org
.. _OCaml: https://ocaml.org


Sometimes people ask me about my setup. It's based on `Free Software`_
and centered around Debian_ GNU/Linux, XMonad_, zsh_ and vim_.

.. _Debian: https://www.debian.org
.. _Free Software: https://www.fsf.org

During my undergraduate studies I was an active member of the `Free &
Open Source Software Community of NTUA`__. Together with fellow students
we created `various tutorials and guides`__, organised and participated
in local free software-related conferences and events, collaborated on
various projects and had a ton of fun : ).
